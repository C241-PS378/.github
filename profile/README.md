Hi everyone! We are from the C241-PS378 team, consisting of 3 Machine Learning students, 2 Cloud Computing students, and 2 Mobile Development students. This is our repository for the CuMa (Cuan Sampah) project. CuMa is the Bangkit 2024 capstone project with the theme of Save Waste, Save Earth, Save Money.

#### 🦺Description :
Indonesia is facing a severe waste management crisis, with approximately 34.29% of
its annual 21.1 million tons of waste not being properly handled. This has led to significant
environmental degradation and health risks. Overcrowded landfills like Piyungan in
Yogyakarta are exacerbating the issue, where it has been closed since 23rd July 2023. In
response to that, our team aims to address this pressing problem by exploring the role of
technology in enhancing efficient waste management and recycling, identifying barriers to
proper waste disposal in Indonesia, and assessing the impact of financial incentives on
encouraging waste recycling efforts. The mismanagement of waste poses substantial
threats to Indonesia's environment, public health, and sustainable development, which are
worsened by traditional disposal methods and insufficient infrastructure.

Our team is working to tackle this issue by developing an e-commerce app that
enables users to sell recyclable waste to other users and/or nearby collectors, thereby
encouraging responsible disposal practices and promoting a circular economy. The app
also includes a marketplace feature to encourage users to sort inorganic waste, benefiting
both the environment and users like local craftsmen. By leveraging innovative technology
and community engagement, our initiative aims to reduce waste accumulation and pave
the way for a greener, more sustainable future in Indonesia.
